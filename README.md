# Senhor Cuidado - Elderly Caregivers

This project aims to experience a website dedicated to finding people interested in taking care of the elderly and looking for elderly people who need special care.
The site was developed to be very simple, without too many details, so that anyone can use it. 
It starts with a mobile-responsive **Homepage** that explains our mission as a company that cares for the elderly and hires specialized caregivers. In addition to the **Homepage**, a login modal was developed to access more features after logged _(functionality not implemented yet)_ and a button for registering.
On the **Registration page**, we have 2 tabs; the Elderly Registration tab where we will collect the necessary information to register the Elderly on our website, also containing the registration of the legal responsible and the caregiver registration tab. Some features have not been implemented yet, such as the search by zip code.
